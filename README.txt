All credit for the creation of the mod goes to Remis and RealDavid. 
Remis has decided to no longer work on the mod so he gave the repo ownership to me, Pogba1.


Hi, I highly recommend you do not play with the base map mod. 
The map mod causes heavy lag in the 1860s and lowers performance heavily.
I highly recommend the DoD map mod as a replacement, but any map mod can do the trick, even the vanilla one.
