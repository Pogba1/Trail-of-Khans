All credit for the creation of the mod goes to Remis and RealDavid. 
Remis has decided to no longer work on the mod so he gave the repo ownership to Pogba1.


The classic ToK map mod has been moved into a separate folder.
If you still want to play with it you can simply drag it into the main ToK mod folder.
It is highly recommended to use the DoD map mod as a replacement if you don't like the Vanilla one or ToK one,
but any map mod can do the trick.
