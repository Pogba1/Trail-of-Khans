synthetic_rubber_factory_desc;Synthetic rubber, like other polymers, is made from various petroleum-based monomers. A mixture of coal and oil is added together and then refined to produce the flammable hydrocarbon naphtha, which is then combined with natural gas to produce monomers. Chemical additives bond together with the monomers to form chains of polymers and the resulting product then undergoes vulcanisation in order to produce synthetic rubber.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
