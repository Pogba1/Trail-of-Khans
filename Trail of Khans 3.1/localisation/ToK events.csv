EVTDESC7637640;The Sicilian sulphur mines have been and continue to be the biggest sources of sulphur production in Europe, this has led to us practically holding a monopoly on the European sulphur market.;x
EVTDESC7637641;The Frasch Process and it's adoption by competing industries has led to our monopoly collapsing and the competitiveness of our mines to drop drastically.;x
EVTDESC144400;Our Horde has ruled over vast lands and collected tribute from it's people for generations now, granting us vast wealth to use in our wars;x
EVTNAME183552301;Ottokar the VIIIth's Triumph;x
EVTDESC183552301;After a grueling and bloody conflict, the Bohemians are victorious over the belligerent Poles and any dream of Polish owned Bohemia has been shattered. Long live King Ottokar!;x
EVTNAME183552303;The People Demand Abdication!;x
EVTDESC183552303;The already unpopular war in Bohemia has turned into an outright disaster for King Wladislaus the IVth. In an unprecedented move from the General Assembly, they have voted that the King abdicate after the failure of the Bohemian campaign. This is a highly treasonous vote, but with an almost unanimous result it is near suicidal to pursue them as criminals.;x
EVTNAME188801;The States General of Poland have convened;x
EVTDESC188801;After the abdication of Wladislaus the IVth, the only heir to the Polish crown is Stanislaus the IIIrd a teenager which will need a regent to take care of affairs and mentor him while his father lives in exile. The States General have thus been convened to assess what candidates would be best fitted to act as regent until Stanislaus' coming of age. The 3 candidates proposed by the States General are : Friedrich Kmiecik the current Duke of Silesia, Sobieski a very influencial Nobleman and General who had been often thwarted by Wladislaus during the Bohemian war, finally there is Kazimierz Pocisk, former general in the Polish army originally exiled by Wladislaus for training the Cossacks unsanctioned by any diplomatic pact, although his exile was never lifted, Wladislaus was the main driving force behind the exile and he has returned seeking to plead the Ruthenian cause to the Polish elites. The vote is up to the general assembly as to who shall lead Poland until Stanislaus ascends to the throne.;x
EVTNAME192801;Wladislaus' Campaign is successful!;x
EVTDESC192801;After many centuries of tension over Bohemia, the Polish crown has once and for all established hegemony over Bohemia. This hasn't come easy though and will require quite some time for the relations with the Czechs to improve.;x
EVTNAME192803;The Unification of Jagiellonia;x
EVTDESC192803;After many centuries of rule over the Jagiellonian holdings, there has been a surge in popularity of the idea of Jagiellonia. This idea originally dating to the 1760s with the philosopher Stanislaw Konarski writing the poem "O' Jagiellonia", this has become reality waiting to happen and there is no better time than with our acquisition of Bohemia. Long live the Emperor!;x
EVTNAME232001;Stalemate for Bohemia;x
EVTDESC232001;With neither side in the Polish-Bohemian war, we have recognized the futility of continuing this war and signed white peace;x
EVTNAME232002;Aftermath of the Status Quo Ante Bellum;x
EVTDESC232002;Although we technically haven't lost this war, we have not won it either. This fact brings great humiliation to Wladislaus and the people have organised protests against his pointless war mongering;x
EVTNAME232003;Aftermath of the Status Quo Ante Bellum;x
EVTDESC232003;Our attempt at erasing Polish claims to Bohemia have failed, but we have not lost anything in the war, leaving us in a precarious position but one of survival.;x
EVTNAME232004;The Invasion of Lithuania;x
EVTDESC232004;With the Poles busy in Bohemia, we shall take the opportunity to weaken their Sphere of Influence. We have the option to either simply invade the Lithuanians and disregard Polish opinion, or we may try to diplomatically resolve this to foster a more amicable relation out of this.;x
EVTNAME232005;The Hansa wants a discussion over Lithuania;x
EVTDESC232005;While we have our hands tied in Bohemia, the Hansa has approached us concerning the Duchy of Lithuania and it's continued existence. They propose a redrawing of Spheres in the Baltic, leaving Lithuania to Hanseatic protection instead of Polish protection, but this is not our only option.;x
EVTNAME232006;The Poles have refused all negotiations!;x
EVTDESC232006;They cite the Treaty of Riga as sufficient for the situation and refuse a redrawing of spheres.;x
EVTNAME232007;The Poles offer a redrawing of spheres!;x
EVTDESC232007;The diplomats sent over have agreed to our proposal and our protection over Lithuania is now in effect!;x
EVTNAME232008;The Poles give us Carte-Blanche in Lithuania!;x
EVTDESC232008;In a remarking turn of events, the diplomats have given us an offer we cannot refuse. This allows us to invade Lithuania with their full support and backing!;x
EVTNAME18808;Stanislaus' Coronation;x
EVTDESC18808;The heir to the Jagiellonian throne has finally come of age, his views are not clear and we will need to see what his first moves as King shall be.;x
EVTNAME18809;The Decree of Skerniewice;x
EVTDESC18809;Poland has a tradition of voting and political representation for both rich and poor through various means, but with the ascension of King Stanislaus the IIIrd to the throne this has come to an abrupt end. The Decree of Skerniewice has suspended all political liberties and ended sufferage for all people of the Kingdom, this comes at the detriment of work done by previous Kings including his father.;x
EVTNAME18810;Friedrich's influence over Stanislaus thought;x
EVTDESC18810;The Duke Friedrich was in charge of the Regency and the overseeing of the education of heir Stanislaus, this gave him the opportunity to shift Stanislaus' view on geopolitics and made him much more interested in involving himself in the power vacuum present in Germany.;x
EVTNAME18811;Sobieski's influence over Stanislaus thought;x
EVTDESC18811;As a promenent nobleman, Sobieski had been chosen for the role of Regent and educator to Stanislaus, much of the wisdom passed over focused on teaching the importance of Jagiellonian unity for the continued relevance of the crown. His plans for a united Jagiellonia has been popular in the past, but the lost of the Bohemian war has taken a severe toll on the movement's popularity and the unification will not be an easy task.;x
EVTNAME18812;Kazimierz's influence over Stanislaus thought;x
EVTDESC18812;An unexpected choice by the general assembly, the former Hetman Kazimierz was chosen as Regent and educator to Stanislaus, this unorthodox pick had spent most of his time as Regent maintaining the political Status Quo to allow him time to indoctrinate Stanislaus into his Ruthenian dream. This has led Stanislaus to have very little care for any sort of Central or Western European affairs, leaving him with a burning desire to kick the Mongols out and establish hegemony over Ruthenia.;x
EVTNAME18813;Hungary Breaks Free!;x
EVTDESC18813;With the increasing lack of care from King Stanislaus over Jagiellonian affairs, a revolt has taken place in Hungary to free themselves from an increasingly distant Poland.;x
EVTOPTA232004;The Treaty of Riga is null!;x
EVTOPTB232004;Let us convene with the Poles over Lithuania;x
EVTOPTA232005;How dare they push for Lithuania?;x
EVTOPTB232005;Offer a redrawing of spheres of influence in the Baltic;x
EVTOPTC232005;We cannot hope to hold Lithuania, give them Carte Blanche;x
EVTOPTA232006;They do not offer us any choice;x
EVTOPTA232007;Great!;x
EVTOPTA232008;We couldn't have hoped for more!;x
EVTNAME18814;The National Anthem of Poland;x
EVTDESC18814;As more and more countries in Europe have adapted hymns and anthems to represent their countries, we too shall. The choice isn't easy since we have many tunes used in our country by different groups of people that represent a sort of national anthem. We shall put it up to a vote in the Sjem, where noblemen shall decide.;x
