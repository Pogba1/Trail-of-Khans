In an unprecedented move from the General Assembly, they have voted that the King abdicate after the failure of the Bohemian campaign.

EVTDESC188801;After the abdication of Wladislaus the IVth, a clear successor candidate was not apparent. The States General have thus been convened to assess what candidates would be best fitted to rule over. The 3 candidates proposed by the States General are : Friedrich Kmiecik the current Duke of Silesia, Sobieski a very influencial Nobleman and General who had been often thwarted by Wladislaus during the Bohemian war, and finally there is Kazimierz Pocisk, he was originally exiled by Wladislaus for unofficially training the Cossacks while being a General himself, he has returned from exile after leading the Cossacks and is now seeking to build a political power base in Poland. The vote is up to the general assembly as to who shall lead Poland into these next troubling years.;x
